*** Tour of the AWS Console & Services in AWS ***

inside AWS Console Home top right corner of your screen, right now, this is what's called the regions selector,
we can select the regions default is Northern Virginia.

- Next in the console console, you will see a list
of recently visited services

- On the bottom you get some information about AWS.
You get the health issues, if need be and cost and usage info for your accounts
as well as tutorials to build a solution and so on.

PS: AWS CONSOLE UI may change in future

- now to look for the service of the AWS:
we 3 ways:
click on icon of square on the left screen (left the search bar)
- click "All Services"
to see all the services ordered by alphabet 

- click "Compute"
to see all the services depends on category

- search bar (fastest way)
example we can search "routes 53"
we will have 4 services that match the search keyword 
and we can look into the feature and we can see blogs and documentation also



- now if go to the "routes 53" in the region selector we can see "Global" 
That means that this console does not require a region selection.
And that is more of the exception than the rule, but some services in AWS are where
it's called global services and no matter where you are you're going to get the same view.
But if you switch services and you go, for example to the EC two service,
this time on the top right hand side, as you can see it says N.Virginia because we leave it default to N.Virginia
And so based if we run this console in  N.Virginia or say in another region, for example, in Canada,
well my view is going to be different

AWS global infrastructure:
if we google it this gives you a lot
of information around your services.

And one thing that is very important to look at so sometimes the service may not be exist depends on the region
