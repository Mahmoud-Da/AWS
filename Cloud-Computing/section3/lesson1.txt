*** AWS Cloud Overview - Regions & AZ ***


- It was launched in 2002 internally at amazon.com
because they realized that the IT departments
could be externalized. Their Amazon infrastructure was one of their core strengths
and they said, you know what?
"Maybe we can do IT for someone else, for other people."

- So they launched their first offering publicly,
which was SQS in 2004.

- In 2006, they expanded their offering
and they relaunched with the availability of SQS S3 and EC2.


Then they expanded and said, you know what?

"We don't have to be just in America.

We could be in Europe."

- so 2007 it launched in Europe

- And then fast forward to today, we have so many applications

that used to run, or are still running on AWS,

such as Dropbox, Netflix, Airbnb, or even the NASA.



If you look at the Magic Quadrant from Gartner,
you can see that AWS is a leader,
and it has been the case for many, many years.
AWS now has $90 billion in revenue as of 2023,
and it accounts for about 31% of the market in Q1 2024,
with Microsoft being second with 25%.
It's been a pioneer and a leader of the market
for 13th consecutive years,
and it has over 1 million active users.


so What can you build on AWS?

- AWS will enable you to build sophisticated and scalable applications,
- applicable to a diverse set of industries.
Uses cases include:
- just transferring your enterprise IT,
- using the cloud as a backup and storage,
- doing some big data analytics.
- You can also host a website,
- create a backend for your mobile
- and your social applications,
- you can have your entire gaming servers
running on the cloud.

AWS is global:
it has
- AWS Regions
- AWS Availability zones
- AWS Data Centers
- AWS Edge locations / points of presence

we can check it inside 
https://infrastructure.aws/



AWS Regions:
- Regions are all around the world (saw it in the map)
- from before the regions have a name.
It could be US-east-1, EU-West-3,
- region is a cluster of data centers

a region, what is in its truly?
- Well, it's going to be a cluster of data centers.
Many different data centers look at it in near,
for example, Ohio, or Singapore, or Sydney, or Tokyo.

When we use AWS services, most services are going to be linked in scope
to a specific region. That means that if we use a service in one region
and we try to use it in another region, it will be like a new time of using the service.


so, how do you choose an AWS region?
Say you're launching a new application,
where should you do it?
Should you do it in America, in Europe, in South America, or in Australia?

- some factors that may impact your choice
- compliance.:
Sometimes governments want the data to be local, to the country you're deploying the application in.
For example, France,
data in France may have to stay in France,
and therefore you should launch your application
in the French region.

- Proximity:
If most of your users are going to be in America, it makes a lot of sense to deploy your application
in America close to your users, because they will have a reduced latency.
If you deploy your application in Australia, and your users are in America,
they will have a lot of lag using your application.


- Available services:
Some regions do not have services, and so obviously if you're leveraging a service
with your application, you need to make sure that the region you're deploying into is available,
and does have that service.

- Pricing:
Pricing does vary from region to region, and you need to consult the app
The services pricing pages to see, what the differences are between the regions.
But this could be obviously a factor that could impact your deployment
of an application into a specific region.


AWS Availability Zones:
what actually are going into the region. Each region will have many availability zones,
usually three, the minimum is three, and the max is six, but really the usual is three.

let's take the Sydney region as an example:
The Sydney region code is ap-southeast-2.
We have two have three availability zones in Sydney,
- ap-southeast-2A
- ap-southeast-2B
- ap-southeast-2C

- each of these availability zones are going to be one
or more discrete data centers that will have redundant power networking and connectivity.

That means that in southeast-2A,
I can have two data centers maybe as well,
2 and 2B, and 2 and 2C.
But it could be one, it could be three, it could be four.
We don't really know, it always doesn't tell us that.

But what we know is that these availability zones, are separate from each other
so that they will be isolated from disasters.
If something happens to ap-southeast-2A, we know that it is designed not to cascade
into ap-southeast-2B, or ap-southeast-2C. They're really isolated from disasters.

And then these data centers, these availability zones, they are connected with high bandwidth,
ultra-low latency networking, and therefore, altogether being linked together,
it will form a region.


AWS points of presence(Edge locations):
- that AWS has more than 400 points of presence in 90 cities,
across 40 countries.
- And this will be very helpful when we deliver content
to the end users with the lowest latency possible.
