*** Creating an AWS Account ***

- so we head to aws.com to create an aws account



first thing you have to do:
- is to specify a route user email address
which is your main email address.

- And they will be used to log to your Amazon accounts.
On top of it, you can specify a name for account.
For example, moody-demo-v3.

- while creating it we use personal and use the free trail
