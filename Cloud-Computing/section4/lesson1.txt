- IAM: Users and Groups
identity and access management. It is a global service 

So we've already used IAM without knowing, when we created an account, we created a root accounts.
- Root account: created by default, shouldn`t be used or shared.
And the only things you should use it for is to set up your account. But then you shouldn't use that account anymore,
or even share it. What you should be doing instead, is create users. So you will create users in IAM,
and one user represents one person within your organization.
And the users can be grouped together if it makes sense.

- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- Groups can only contains users, not other groups 
- Users don`nt have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

ex: example we have an organization
with six people. You have Alice, Bob, Charles, David, Edward
and Fred so all these people are in your organization. Now Alice, Bob, and Charles they work together.
They're all developers. So we're going to create a group called the group developers who regrouping Alice, Bob and Charles.
And it turns out that David and Edward also work together. So we're going to create an operations group.
Now, some users don't have to belong to a group. For example, Fred right here is alone, he does not correspond to any group.
PS: That is not best practice. But it is something you can do in AWS.
And also, a user can belong to multiple groups. That means that for example, if you know that Charles
and David worked together, and they're part of your audit team, you can create a third group with Charles and David.


- IAM: Permissions
- So why do we create users and why do we create groups?
Well, because we want to allow them to use our AWS accounts and to allow them to do so,
we have to give them permissions.

- users or groups can be assigned what's called a JSON document called policy.
policy: what a user is allowed to do or what a group and all the users within that group are allowed to do.

So in this example, we can see that we allow people to use the EC2 to service and do describe on it,
to use the elastic load balancing service and to describe on it and to use CloudWatch.

- these policies will help us define permissions for our users.

And so in AWS, you don't allow everyone to do everything that would be catastrophic,
because a new user could basically launch so many services and they will cost you a lot of money or would be valid for security.

- in AWS, you apply a principle called the least privilege principle. So you don't give more permissions than a user needs.
